# Clock

This project displays an anagram clock with 12 and 6 as markers. The clock has an hour hand, minute hand , and a second hand. 

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, ES6


I created divs for the clock and the hands. I rotated the hand by it's origin point- 100%. For the javascript, I made variables for each hand on the clock. I made a function to set the movement of the hands. Each hand moves periodically 360 degrees around the clock--one per second, one per every minute, and another every hour. 
## Optimizations
I want it to also show the time digitally, and I want to add a 3 and 9 to the clock. 
## Lessons Learned:
I learned about rotating a div by it's origin point.
